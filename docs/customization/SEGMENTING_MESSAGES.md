# Segmenting Messages

Sometimes, you may want to stylize individual parts of a complex message differently.
For example, if printing a key and value - you may want to have one style for the key, and a different one for the value, like so:

For this purpose, we can segment this single message into individual parts, and apply styles independently to each segment.

Whenever you create a `LoggieMsg`, you are automatically creating its first segment.

```gdscript
## Creates a message with one segment and stylizes that segment.
Loggie.msg("SegmentKey").bold().color(Color.ORANGE)
```

Now we can use the function `endseg` to end that segment, and begin a new one. 
If we apply any stylings - they will only be applied to the newest segment.

```gdscript
Loggie.msg("SegmentKey").bold().endseg().add("SegmentValue")
```

There, we ended the first segment *(and therefore started the next one)*, and added the text  `"SegmentValue"` in the next segment. Now if we chain `italic()`:

```gdscript
Loggie.msg("SegmentKey").bold().endseg().add("SegmentValue").italic()
```

Only the `"SegmentValue"` part of the message will be italic.

There is a shortcut for `endseg() + add()`, which is just calling `msg` again. 
So, instead of the above, we can write:

```gdscript
Loggie.msg("SegmentKey").bold().msg("SegmentValue").italic()
```

This keeps it shorter and more in line with what you're used to writing (`msg`).
