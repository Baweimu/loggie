Loggie can be configured to log the specs of the device running your project at launch, giving you a neat overview of all the details you may be interested in for debugging purposes.

To enable this behavior, go to **Project Settings -> Loggie -> General -> Show System Specs**:

If you are [using Custom Settings](../customization/CUSTOM_SETTINGS.md), you can set this in the `load()` method instead:

```
show_system_specs = true
```
